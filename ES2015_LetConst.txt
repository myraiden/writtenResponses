***var*** = scopes a variable, but can be redeclared anywhere in the code
***let*** = block-scopes a variable, so it cannot be redeclared

- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?
**var** = can be reassigned or redeclared
***const*** = cannot be reassigned or redeclared

- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?
